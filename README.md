# React_Practice
Web similar to Wallapop made with React

## What did I use?

- Create-react-app
```
npx create-react-app nameOfApp
```


## How to start


- For development use
Typing in the same folder where the proyect is:
´´´
npm start
´´´
This command initialises the development server on port 3000 by default.

- Creting and serving the final web
Typing in the same folder where the proyect is:
´´´
npm build
´´´
This command create the optimized version (production) ready for server.

A new folder called 'build' will be created and inside you can find the file 'index.html'.

- Run de App
Type in the same folder where the proyect is:
```
npx serve -s build
```

Enjoy!!
